        <p>Every one of us has some kind of liking/ disliking for certain things in life. Similarly I love drawing because drawing do not cost much and is always fun. Drawing is my favorite hobby. I cannot imagine a colorful life without drawing. My greatest inspiration is my mother who always encourages me to design her dresses. It is my believe that to display your art you do not have to be a great artist. You just have to make a unique piece. So get your paint brush and pencil and start drawing. When I am blue I cheer myself up by drawing something so that I can make myself happy. Drawing is a way for me to show my creativity. However drawing is not as easy as it seems to be. It needs a lot of devotion as well as practice. I can never feel bored when I have my colors with me. My colors are my best friend. I like drawing since I was 6 years old. I like to make unrealistic things look realistic through drawing. Drawing is the perfect way to make things look alive. I imagine all kinds of strange things to show it on a piece of paper such as hell & demons, a beautiful house in heaven etc. I have decorated my house with lot of my drawings. Every year I gift my grandparents and parents with my drawing on their anniversaries because they are very fond of my drawings and always encourage me to practice more. Drawing has now become the most important part of my life. But most of the times I am unable to take out much time due to my studies and social life. But still I manage to take out sometime and practice to improve my drawing. The most attractive and unique part of my drawing is the concept of demons and horror. I love to choose these unique concepts because they look weird and scare people sometimes. My leisure hours are always occupied to my drawing paper, pen and brush. The strangest thing about my hobby is that nobody taught me how to paint. Even when I was in school drawing was not my subject. I learnt it by myself and later got inspiration by my parents. I learnt few concepts through text book containing different types of sketches. I have always intimated everything from those books such as rivers, hills, trees, human faces, clouds and animals. With days my drawing improved step by steps and is still improving. I constantly make efforts to retain my hobby.
